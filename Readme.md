# Steps to install extension

* Download the zip by clicking 'Clone/Download' button 
* Navigate to URL *chrome://extensions/* and turn on the *developer mode* option on top right corner
* Access the *Load unpacked* option on top left corner
* Select the folder where the previously download zip was extracted
* Tiny icon for *podbuddy* will appear next to URL bar 
* Register with your GUID after clicking on the podbuddy icon.

# Usage

* Right-click the selected query, click on the *Add SQL to repo* option
* Enter Query name and description in pipe-delimited format (*my query name | its description*) 
* The recently added query will be available for all the users to use
* Click on the *caret icon* on the extension-page to populate the sql-worksheet's textarea with that query
* Rest of the features are self explanatory (delete your queries, use copy button, default appearance of alter session queries)

* Delete and add features will be obviously not supported in offline mode
* All other features of accessing queries, copying, automatic pasting on care-icon click to textarea will be supported.
